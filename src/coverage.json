        "summary": "Fix Weekly Progress Chart data calculation and binding so it displays non-zero values by computing stats from the same tasks array used by Daily Progress Chart, filtering those tasks to the current week (Monday 00:00:00.000 through Sunday 23:59:59.999 local time), and aggregating counts and completed-time correctly.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- In `frontend/src/components/studyPlanner/WeeklyProgressChart.tsx`, compute `currentWeekTasks` by filtering `tasks` where the task date falls within the current week.\n- Ensure the task date is read from the same field used today (`task.date`) but correctly normalized for both backend tasks and guest tasks:\n  - Backend tasks use an optional date shape from the generated candid types (e.g., `[] | [Time]`), so unwrap the optional before passing into `normalizeTaskDate`.\n  - Guest tasks may use `number | undefined` for `date`; continue supporting that.\n- Weekly task counts must be derived from `currentWeekTasks`:\n  - `Total Tasks` = `currentWeekTasks.length`\n  - `Completed` = tasks in `currentWeekTasks` with `isCompleted === true`\n  - `Pending` = tasks in `currentWeekTasks` with `isCompleted === false`\n- Weekly total time must be the sum of study time for ONLY completed tasks in `currentWeekTasks` (not all weekly tasks). Use existing duration parsing/formatting utilities so minutes/hours are handled consistently.\n- Ensure the computed values are the ones bound to the existing Weekly Progress Chart UI (donut chart + stats grid) without changing any UI, colors, layout, or text.\n- Ensure the weekly chart recalculates immediately when tasks change (add/delete/toggle complete) by keeping calculations derived directly from the `tasks` prop and React memoization dependencies.",
