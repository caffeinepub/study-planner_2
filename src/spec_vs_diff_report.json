      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Keep the existing Study Planner progress bar exactly as-is (no restyle/move), directly below the task panel heading and directly above the task list, with percentage text.",
      "reason": "StudyPlannerPage.tsx diff is truncated before the relevant header/progress bar markup; the diff summary does not show the actual JSX/CSS ensuring position/unchanged styling.",

      "requirement": "Group ALL action buttons (Sort by Date & Time/Default, Clear, Download TXT, Download PDF) together top-right in a single row in the task list CardHeader; none elsewhere; no label/icon changes.",
      "reason": "Truncated StudyPlannerPage.tsx does not show the CardHeader/button layout, so grouping/placement and exact labels/icons cannot be confirmed from the diff.",

      "requirement": "Remove large/filled background colors from each task card; use neutral/light default card background; subject color only as small pill Subject badge; priority only as small badge.",
      "reason": "Task card JSX/styles are not visible in the truncated StudyPlannerPage.tsx diff; cannot confirm removal of colored backgrounds or confinement of color to badges only.",

      "requirement": "Restore compact task card layout: checkbox left; subject+badges; topic; small duration + date/time text; delete (trash) icon right; no redesign/expand/emphasis.",
      "reason": "Truncated StudyPlannerPage.tsx does not include the task row/card render, so structure/alignment and absence of expandable UI cannot be verified.",
