  "summary": "The diff summary does not provide enough concrete code evidence (due to truncation) to verify that the Daily progress bar is rendered/placed/computed per requirements or that targeted console logging was added. Additionally, the included file summary text indicates multiple UI/behavior changes beyond the requested Daily progress bar fix.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Render the existing Study Planner progress bar UI in the Daily view (only when Daily tab active) using the same Progress component/styling as Weekly, without changing Weekly behavior.",
      "reason": "The provided StudyPlannerPage.tsx snippet is truncated before any progress bar render logic; it only shows imports/state/filtering and does not evidence conditional rendering tied to the Daily tab nor preservation of Weekly behavior.",

      "requirement": "Place the Daily progress bar exactly under the 'Your Daily Study Tasks' heading and above the daily task list, matching Weekly spacing, without moving buttons/cards/layout or adding new positioning wrappers.",
      "reason": "No JSX/markup around the 'Your Daily Study Tasks' heading or task list is visible in the truncated diff, so placement, spacing, and non-movement constraints cannot be verified.",

      "requirement": "Compute Daily progress using Daily tasks only and hide the bar when there are 0 Daily tasks; show with rounded percent when N>0; update immediately on task changes.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet does not show the daily/weekly progress calculations, render condition (daily total > 0), or percentage rounding, so the computation and visibility rules cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "If still not rendering, add targeted console logging in StudyPlannerPage.tsx to log currentView, daily total, daily completed, computed percent (no UI changes).",
      "reason": "No console logging statements are visible in the truncated StudyPlannerPage.tsx diff excerpt, so this requirement cannot be verified as implemented.",
