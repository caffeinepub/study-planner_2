  "summary": "The diff does not provide concrete, non-truncated code evidence that the Topic/Date/Time inputs and labels in the Study Planner form were actually restyled per REQ-1. The only mention of the requested change appears in a text summary file, which is insufficient to verify implementation. The diff also includes unrequested updates to project metadata and feature-summary documentation content.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Adjust the Study Planner “Add Study Task” form so that the Topic, Date, and Time fields appear visually lighter without changing layout structure or component sizing: set input text font-weight to 400 for Topic/Date/Time, reduce label font-weight, ensure consistent padding with other fields, keep input height unchanged, keep border radius and color scheme unchanged, and do not affect Subject dropdown styling.",
      "reason": "The provided StudyPlannerPage.tsx diff is truncated and contains no visible changes showing font-weight/padding/className adjustments for the Topic/Date/Time Inputs or their Labels, nor evidence that Subject dropdown styling was left untouched. The only explicit mention of the change is in a summary text file, which is not proof of implementation.",

      "description": "Updated documentation/summary to claim many Study Planner features (e.g., exports, enhanced validation, progress bar, action button grouping) beyond the requested styling change.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to lightening visual weight of Topic/Date/Time fields only; the diff includes expanded feature descriptions in a summaries file not requested by the spec.",

      "description": "Added/updated project tracking entries (AR-1, AR-2) and project state metadata changes.",
