  "summary": "WeeklyProgressChart.tsx was updated to compute weekly stats from the `tasks` prop using `useMemo`, filter tasks to the current week, and bind computed totals/completed/pending/totalTime to the existing UI. However, the diff does not show the required unwrapping of backend optional date values before passing to `normalizeTaskDate`. Two ancillary files were also modified without being requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend tasks use an optional date shape (e.g., [] | [Time]); unwrap the optional before passing into `normalizeTaskDate` when computing `currentWeekTasks`.",
      "reason": "The implementation calls `normalizeTaskDate(task.date)` directly. The diff shows no unwrapping/normalization step for the candid optional date shape prior to calling `normalizeTaskDate`, so the specific requirement is not evidenced as implemented.",
