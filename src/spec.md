# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Topic, Date, and Time fields in the Study Planner “Add Study Task” form look visually lighter while preserving the existing layout, sizing, and theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Set the Topic, Date, and Time input text font-weight to normal (400) without changing their existing height, border radius, or colors.
- Reduce the Label font-weight for Topic, Date, and Time so labels are not bold, keeping current placement/alignment.
- Ensure padding for Topic/Date/Time inputs matches the other form fields (only where currently inconsistent).
- Limit styling changes to Topic/Date/Time only; do not change the Subject dropdown styling.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Study Planner page, the Topic/Date/Time fields appear less bold/heavy (lighter labels and input text) while everything else, including layout, sizing, and the Subject dropdown, remains unchanged.
