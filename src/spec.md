# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Promote draft version 73 to the Live/Production channel as a metadata-only release change.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/.release/production-version.txt` to reference draft version `73`.
- Perform the release promotion without modifying any application source files under `frontend/src/`.

**User-visible outcome:** End users are served draft version 73 in the live/production channel after deployment.
